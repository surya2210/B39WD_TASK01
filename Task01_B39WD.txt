1.Difference Between Http1 And Http2?

.HTTP1 loads a single request for every TCP connection.
.HTTP/1.1 loads resources one after the other, so if one resource cannot be loaded, 
it blocks all the other resources behind it.
.Established IN 1997
.It is relatively secure since it uses digest authentication, NTLM authentication.


HTTP2
.HTTP2 is much faster and more reliable than HTTP1
.HTTP/2 is able to use a single TCP connection to send multiple streams of data at
 once so that no one resource blocks any other resource.
.Established In 2015
.Security concerns from previous versions will continue to be seen in HTTP/2. However, 
it is better equipped to deal with them due to new TLS features like connection error of type Inadequate_Security.
